## About
I have been a fitness trainer for seven years and will help you get 100kg bench press. This project is an application with a training program that allows you to bench press 100kg in the shortest possible time. The website provides an easy-to-use interface for determining the starting level and building a training plan to reach the goal as soon as possible.
